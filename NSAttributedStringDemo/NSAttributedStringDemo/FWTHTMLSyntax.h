I think it needs to be added that\nthe set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected\nthose elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules,\nin my opionion.</p>\n<div>This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead\nof paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)</div>\n<blockquote><p>This is a block quotation containing a single\nparagraph.

Note that\nthe spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard\nto tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are\nlogically related to a list, e.g. as a \"list header\".</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> One.\n  <li> Two.\n  <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that\nfor short items lists look better if they are compactly presented,\n       whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.\n  <li> Four. This is the last item in this list.\n       Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.\n</ul>\n<p>The following is a <code>menu</code> list:</p>\n<menu>\n  <li> One.\n  <li> Two.\n  <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will\nprobably wrap to the next line in rendering.\n</menu>\n<p>The following is a <code>dir</code> list:</p>\n<dir>\n  <li> One.\n  <li> Two.\n  <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will\nprobably wrap to the next line in rendering.\n</dir>\n\n<p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>numbered</strong> list (<code>ol</code>).

This is the last item in this list.\n       Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>definition</strong> list (<code>dl</code>).\nIn principle, such a list should consist of <em>terms</em> and associated \ndefinitions.\nBut many authors use <code>dl</code> elements for fancy \"layout\" things. Usually the\neffect is not <em>too</em> bad, if you design user style sheet rules for <code>dl</code>\nwhich are suitable\nfor real definition lists.\n<dl>\n  <dt> recursion\n  <dd> see recursion\n  <dt> recursion, indirect\n  <dd> see indirect recursion\n  <dt> indirect recursion\n  <dd> see recursion, indirect\n  <dt> term\n  <dd> a word or other expression taken into specific use in\n       a well-defined meaning, which is often defined rather rigorously, even\n       formally, and may differ quite a lot from an everyday meaning\n</dl>\n\n<h2>Text-level markup</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li> <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr> (an abbreviation;\n <code>abbr</code> markup used)\n  <li> <acronym title=\"radio detecting and ranging\">radar</acronym> (an acronym; <code>acronym</code> markup used)\n  <li> <b>bolded</b> (<code>b</code> markup used - just bolding with unspecified\n       semantics)\n  <li> <big>big thing</big> (<code>big</code> markup used)\n  <li> <font size=6>large size</font> (<code>font size=6</code> markup used)\n  <li> <font face=Courier>Courier font</font> (<code>font face=Courier</code> markup used)\n  <li> <font color=red>red text</font> (<code>font color=red</code> markup used)\n  <li> <cite>Origin of Species</cite> (a book title;\n       <code>cite</code> markup used)\n  <li> <code>a[i] = b[i] + c[i);</code> (computer code; <code>code</code> markup used)\n  <li> here we have some <del>deleted</del> text (<code>del</code> markup used)\n  <li> an <dfn>octet</dfn> is an entity consisting of eight bits\n       (<code>dfn</code> markup used for the term being defined)\n  <li> this is <em>very</em> simple (<code>em</code> markup used for emphasizing\n       a word)\n  <li> <i lang=\"la\">Homo sapiens</i> (should appear in italics;  <code>i</code> markup used)\n  <li> here we have some <ins>inserted</ins> text (<code>ins</code> markup used)\n  <li> type <kbd>yes</kbd> when prompted for an answer (<code>kbd</code> markup\n       used for text indicating keyboard input)\n  <li> <q>Hello!</q> (<code>q</code> markup used for quotation)\n  <li> He said: <q>She said <q>Hello!</q></q> (a quotation inside a quotation)\n  <li> you may get the message <samp>Core dumped</samp> at times\n       (<code>samp</code> markup used for sample output)\n  <li> <small>this is not that important</small> (<code>small</code> markup used)\n  <li> <strike>overstruck</strike> (<code>strike</code> markup used; note:\n       <code>s</code> is a nonstandard synonym for <code>strike</code>)\n  <li> <strong>this is highlighted text</strong> (<code>strong</code>\n       markup used)\n  <li> In order to test how subscripts and superscripts (<code>sub</code> and\n       <code>sup</code> markup) work inside running text, we need some\n       dummy text around constructs like x<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O\n       (where subscripts occur). So here is some fill so that\n       you will (hopefully) see whether and how badly the subscripts\n       and superscripts mess up vertical spacing between lines.\n       Now superscripts: M<sup>lle</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, and then some\n       mathematical notations: e<sup>x</sup>, sin<sup>2</sup> <i>x</i>,\n       and some nested superscripts (exponents) too:\n       e<sup>x<sup>2</sup></sup> and f(x)<sup>g(x)<sup>a+b+c</sup></sup>\n       (where 2 and a+b+c should appear as exponents of exponents).\n  <li> <tt>text in monospace font</tt> (<code>tt</code> markup used)\n  <li> <u>underlined</u> text (<code>u</code> markup used)\n  <li> the command <code>cat</code> <var>filename</var> displays the\n       file specified by the <var>filename</var> (<code>var</code> markup\n       used to indicate a word as a variable).\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of the elements tested above are typically displayed in a monospace\nfont, often using the <em>same</em> presentation for all of them. This\ntests whether that is the case on your browser:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li> <code>This is sample text inside code markup</code>\n  <li> <kbd>This is sample text inside kbd markup</kbd>\n  <li> <samp>This is sample text inside samp markup</samp>\n  <li> <tt>This is sample text inside tt markup</tt>\n</ul>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"../index.html\">main page</a>\n<li> <a href=\n\"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch06.pdf\"\ntitle=\"Writing Systems and Punctuation\"\ntype=\"application/pdf\"\n>Unicode Standard, chapter&nbsp;6</a>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a text paragraph that contains some\ninline links.
